Introduction
============

Picktor is a 3D printable pick and place head for surface mount electronics components. 

It mounts on a 3D printer and uses a needle and vacuum pump to pick up small components and place them on a circuit board. 

*While I've tested this and it seems to work for me consider it an alpha quality product, it may not work for you, it may break your printer, it may ruin your circuit boards...*
